# Automatic-Pet-Feeder

### **About:**
The latest surveys conducted throughout the nation concluded that due to our busy lifestyle and job schedules the dream of many pet-lovers to have a fur ball is just stuck in their bucket list.Even if they manage to get a pet, there are issues that bothers them all the time, especially for people who live alone.One of major issues is not being able to feed their pet on time and also the inability to communicate when not near it.The motive of our project, ‘Automatic Pet Feeder’, is to free the owner from the worry of feeding his pet, so that he can do his job without any concern and the lovely animal will also not suffer and starve. Here we introduce our Automatic Pet Feeder which will pour the food in the bowl for the pet on just one click of the owner or by pre-setting a timer.

### **Proposed Solution:**
The solution infers with the extraction of food from the holder on the command of the owner. As stated earlier, the owner will command the release of food from the container by clicking a button on the Blynk application, installed in the device of the owner. On receiving the command, the Node MCU will pass the message to the servo motor to rotate and open the aperture for the food to fall down. The servo motor will rotate back and forth at an angle of 90 degrees for the specified amount of time for the limited amount of food to fall out.

After the rotation, the food will be filled in the tank or the container. After the servo motor rotates back to the original position, there is a buzzer attached to the system, which will buzz to intimidate the domesticated that the food is released and that he can have it as it’s food time. On hearing the buzzer, the pet can have its food, in turning assuring the timely nourishment of the tamed.
